# Part 1 : The Agile Android Toolbox {-}

In the following chapters, we will guide you, step by step, and setup an highly productive and portable agile software development environment.  You will learn to use docker to setup a development environment that will be portable, versionable in git (yeah!) and that you will be able to share with other developers (if your development team grows).
We will also setup a continuous integration (CI) server, an artefact repository server and other tools that will be helpful to *DRY* our android development workflow.
