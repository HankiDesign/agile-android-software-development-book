## Cover image and illustations

All illustrations of this book, unless specified otherwise, are the original creations of either my daughters, Lea and Marianne, or myself.  

Lea draw the cover image for me on the whiteboard after she saw the Android mascot somewhere in my home office.  I colored and edited the original drawing using GIMP.

Thanks Lea & Marianne.
