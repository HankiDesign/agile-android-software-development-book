# Appendix : About technological watch and agility {-}

In the following chapters, I teach you the tips and tricks I've learned over the years that will help you effectively follow the trends in our ever-evolving field. I also give you the techniques to help you select the best tools among a group of equivalent candidates. These techniques apply not only to Android libraries and tools, but to all ranges of tools used in IT in general.  I use them every day whenever the need for a new tool arises. Finally, I present my Agile Android programming philosophy.
