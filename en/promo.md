# Merci!  {-}

I hope that you have enjoyed what you have read so far---it is only a small peek at what's coming up next!\
\
\
If not already, register to our [free mailing list](http://eepurl.com/XTV8H) to be informed about *Agile Android Software Development* or---even better---[pre-order your copy](https://symbiosoft.dpdcart.com/cart/add?product_id=93546&method_id=98033) of the book.  Not only will you get the book at discount price (**25% OFF** for a limited time) you will also get an *early access* to preview chapters, cheat sheets, source code and such---before everyone else!\

\
One more thing, to help me write a book that meet---or exceed---readers expectations I would kindly ask you to fill this online survey: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qhRkSJjbPMOnJ1VGmX-ta0Rxf5hUbblzJhdBb-96tkc/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qhRkSJjbPMOnJ1VGmX-ta0Rxf5hUbblzJhdBb-96tkc/viewform).  It should not take more than a couple of minutes to complete, but it will help me a lot!
\
\
**Note:** The *book extract is available in PDF only*. The pre-order chapters and the final book are available in PDF, .epub and .mobi formats.\

Thanks for your interest, and your support.\
